Description: Ethnic NewsWatch database, provided by ProQuest, has complied more than 2.5 million articles published in the US ethnic newspapers and magazines. This rich information provides rare opportunities for researchers to study race and ethnicity in US historically in a data-intensive way. This suite of functions allow R users to turn unstructured Ethnic NewsWatch search results into tidyvers-ready dataframes.
