# Proquest-News-Analysis

This project uses Python to turn search results (in HTML format) from ProQuest newspaper archive into CSV files (see html_parsing) and R to preprocess (remove HTML tags, etc.,) these CSV fiels (see csv_preprocessing).


## Updates
Proquest no longer allows users to save search results in HTML format. I updated my Python script to deal with this problem.
