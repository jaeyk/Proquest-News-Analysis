# Proquest-News-Analysis

This project uses Python to turn ProQuest newspaper archive search results (in HTML format) into csv files (see html_parsing) and R to preprocess (remove HTML tags, etc.,) these CSV fiels (see csv_preprocessing).



## Updates
Proquest no longer allows save search results in HTML format. I wrote a new Python script that can get around this problem.
